<h2>SUCCESS STORIES AT HEALTH HAVEN</h2>
<br>
<h1 >JIM LOST 40 POUNDS IN JUST 3 MONTHS!</h1>

<br><br>
<p>
Jim knew he wanted to lose weight but couldn't find the motivation to get started.
<br><br>
"I even moved into an apartment block that had gym facilities, and I said every day that I'd go tomorrow, and tomorrow that never happened. I promised myself I would change my diet, eat more healthily, and it didn’t happen."
<br><br>
After realizing his weight had increased to 240 pounds, he decided to enlist in help.
<br><br>
Some Googling led JIM to a nearby gym-HEALTH HAVEN—that specialized in dramatic body transformations. At first, JIM was skeptical, but ultimately signed up with the gym. With the help of a trainer, the NY man learned about counting macros: the carbs, protein, and fat in food. Changing his diet, logging at least 10,000 steps each day, and training three days a week helped Ellengold see results. Over time, he increased gym sessions and steps, resulting in a 40-pound weight loss in just 3 months!

<h1>SARAH LOST 30 POUNDS IN 2 MONTHS!</h1>
<br><br>
<p>Sara spent most of her young-adult life in a pattern of losing weight on various diets, and then gaining it all back.
<br><br>
 In January 2017, she hit 325 pounds—her second heaviest weight—and decided to seek treatment from a mental health professional to address her unhealthy eating habits.
<br><br>
"I realized I needed help when I found myself living the same dismal day over and over again—and food was my only oasis," Sarah told Women's Health in April 2019. 
<br><br>
"It took therapy to make me realize how awful my eating habits had become: I ate from the moment I woke up to the moment I went to bed."
<br><br>
Once she joined -HEALTH HAVEN- weight loss program Sarah was able to cut out fast food, reduce her portion sizes, and start exercising daily for 45 minutes. She lost 190 pounds in two years, and today, she says she takes things "one meal, or one moment, at a time."

<h1>PAM LOST 50 POUNDS IN 4 MONTHS!</h1>
<p>Pam was always a stress eater, and between being a lonely army wife and grieving after losing a baby, she had plenty of difficult emotions to deal with.
<br><br> 
After she gave birth to her son, she realized she needed to pull a 180. "Don't let your mind get in the way," was the refrain Whitney kept telling herself — and it worked.
<br><br>
First, she joined a 9Round Kickboxing gym. The 30-minute circuit workout was a mix of things like planks and tire flips with high-intensity cardio.
<br><br>
She lost 10 pounds in the first month, which gave her the motivation to clean up her diet. From there, she cut out fast food and processed snacks and ate a balanced diet centered on lean protein, fruits, nuts, and whole grains.
<br><br>
She's since lost 90 pounds. Carving 30 minutes a day for herself has made all of the difference: "So many of us tell ourselves that we're selfish if we make time for ourselves, especially if we care for families," she says. "But the 30 minutes a day I made for myself has led to me playing outside more with my kids, and being a more confident mom!"
